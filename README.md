# CSS-Variables-by-Building-a-City-Skyline
## Day to Night City Skyline

This project showcases a dynamic city skyline that transitions from day to night.  To fully appreciate the effect, you may need to adjust the `max-width` in the media query within the CSS.  Try setting it to a lower value, such as `10px` or 300px and 500px depending on your browser, to trigger the transition.  This will allow you to see the nighttime and daytime view.  Experiment with different values to find the one that works best for you.
## Happy Coding! ðŸ˜Š
